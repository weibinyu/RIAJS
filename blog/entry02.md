# Hello World Done
This week i looked up on React, Redux and React Router, mostly react. I couldn't get much more than how they are and why we should
use them from reading, but i'm sure i will learn more once i start writing code using them. And now after i am done with the hello
world app, i feel like began to understand how we use react and why.

I have took a look at the demo app, it was fun but i still not sure what to do for my project hopefully i can decied what to do this
week and began with it.
